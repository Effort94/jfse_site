1) Download the repisotory, anywhere on your C Drive.

2) Open the project with your Code Editor.

3) In the Terminal of your Code Editor, (if you don't have one, you can do this also using CMD, navigating to the root of the project). Run the command:

    - docker-compose up
    
This will build the containers and the application for the local environment.

Once this has been built, simply navigate to localhost:8080.
